# AI-Safety SCAV

This is the code for the embedding-level attack of our NeurIPS 2024 paper *<strong>Uncovering Safety Risks of Large Language Models through Concept Activation Vector</strong>*.

This is an enhanced version of our original experiments in the paper, thus the parameters or settings may be slightly different. You can try the attack demo by `demo_attack.ipynb`.

Should you have any issue, feel free to raise at the issue board or [email](mailto:rhuangbi@connect.ust.hk) us.
